# Secure Share - Privacy Preserving Keyword Search

A modern, responsive, single-page React website for presenting an academic BCA project on privacy-preserving keyword search with secret sharing and access control for cloud data outsourcing.

## 🔐 Project Overview

This project implements a **Privacy Preserving Keyword Search with Access Control for Secret Sharing-Based Data Outsourcing** system. It demonstrates how sensitive data can be securely stored in the cloud while maintaining searchability and implementing fine-grained access control through advanced cryptographic techniques.

## ✨ Features

- **Secret Sharing**: Data divided into encrypted shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
- **Keyword Search**: Efficient keyword searches on encrypted data without revealing content
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained attribute-based access control mechanisms
- **Cloud Outsourcing**: Secure data outsourcing to cloud infrastructure
- **High Performance**: Optimized algorithms for fast search operations
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Complete data encryption throughout its lifecycle

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, AOS.js
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **Build Tool**: Vite
